      "Somewhere along the line people got the modern idea that fun was there for the asking, that people deserved fun, that if we didn't have a little fun every day we would turn into (sakes alive!) puritans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was it fun?\" became the question that overshadowed all other questions: good questions like: Was it moral? Was it kind? Was it honest? Was it beneficial? Was it generous? Was it necessary? And (my favorite) was it selfless?\n",
      "\n",
      "When the pleasure got to be the main thing, the fun fetish was sure to follow. Everything was supposed to be fun. If it wasn't fun, then we were going to make it fun, or else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of all the things that got the reputation of being fun. Family outings were supposed to be fun. Education was supposed to be fun. Work was supposed to be fun. Walt Disney was supposed to be fun. Church was supposed to be fun. Staying fit was supposed to be fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure that everybody knew how much fun we were having, we put happy faces on flunking test papers, dirty bumpers, sticky refrigerator doors, bathroom mirrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a kid, looking at his very happy parents traipsing through that very happy Disney World, said, \"This ain't fun, ma,\" his ma's heart sank. She wondered where she had gone wrong. Everybody told her what fun family outings to Disney World would be. Golly gee, what was the matter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fun got to be such a big thing that everybody started to look for more and more thrilling ways to supply it. One way was to step up the level of danger so that you could be sure that, no matter what, you would manage to have a little fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Television commercials brought a lot of fun and fun-loving folks into the picture. Everything that people in those commercials did looked like fun: taking Polaroid snapshots, buying insurance, mopping the floor, bowling, taking aspirin. The more commercials people watched, the more they wondered when the fun would start in their own lives. It was pretty depressing.\n",

Your honeymoon was supposed to be the epitome of fundom. And so we ended up going through every Big Event we ever celebrated, waiting for the fun to start.\n",

The god of mirth is paying us back for all those years of thinking fun was everywhere by refusing to come to our party. I don't want to blaspheme fun anymore. When fun comes in on little dancing feet, you probably won't be expecting it. In fact, I bet it comes when you're doing your duty, your job, or your work. It may even come on a Tuesday.\n",

      "I remember one day, long ago, on which I had an especially good time. Pam Davis and I walked to the College Village drug store one Saturday morning to buy some candy. We were about 12 years old. She got her Bit-O-Honey. I got my malted milk balls, chocolate stars, Chunkys, and a small bag of M & M's. We started back to her house. I was going to spend the night. We had the whole day to look forward to. We had plenty of candy. It was a long way to Pam's house but every time we got weary Pam would put her hand over her eyes, scan the horizon like a sailor and say, \"Oughta reach home by nightfall,\" at which point the two of us would laugh until we thought we couldn't stand it another minute. Then after we got calm, she'd say it again. You should have been there. It was the kind of day and friendship and occasion that made me deeply regretful that I had to grow up.\n",

      "Bringing a white shark to the aquarium wasn't easy. For fifty years aquariums have tried to keep white sharks alive, but the sharks would not eat in captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby shark had been caught accidentally by a halibut fisherman off the coast of Southern California. Mr. O'Sullivan and his team knew that white sharks were sometimes caught this way. The aquarium had a special floating pen waiting in coastal waters nearby. While the shark lived in the pen, she was fed the same things she would have eaten in the wild-smaller sharks and other fish. The floating pen helped her get used to living in a small space.\n",
      "\n",
      "After living in the pen for 26 days, the shark was put into a special 3,000-gallon tank and driven north to the aquarium. She was given a quick health check and slipped into the million-gallon Outer Bay Exhibit tank. The next morning, the shark ate\n",

      "In just six and a half months, the shark grew two feet in length and more than doubled in weight. Scientists were surprised at how quickly she grew.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tag told scientists that the shark was alive and had swum 200 miles south since her release. This is as close as any shark gets to sending a postcard: \"The water is fine. Wish you were here!\"\n",

      "When John Adams and his fellow patriots were mulling independence from England in the spring of 1776, Abigail Adams famously urged her husband to \"remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.\" Otherwise, she warned, \"we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The campaign for women's rights began in earnest in 1848 at a Women's Rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., organized by 32-year-old Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other advocates. Stanton had drafted a ''Womanifesto'' patterned on the Declaration of Independence, but the one resolution that shocked even some of her supporters was a demand for equal voting rights, also known as universal suffrage. \"I saw clearly,\" Stanton later recalled, \"that the power to make the laws was the right through which all other rights could be secured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stanton was joined in her campaign by Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, and other crusaders who would become icons of the women's movement. Some were militant.

      "They staged demonstrations, engaged in civil disobedience, began legal challenges, and pressed their case state by state. In 1869, the Wyoming Territory gave women the vote, with the first permanent suffrage law in the nation. (\"It made sense that a place like Wyoming would embrace women's rights,\" Gail Collins of The New York Times wrote in her book America's Women. \"With very few women around, there was no danger that they could impose their will on the male majority.\")\n",

      "In 1878, a constitutional amendment was introduced in Congress. The legislation languished for nine years. In 1887, the full Senate considered the amendment for the first time and defeated it by about 2-to-1. \n",

      "Plenty of opposition existed, according to Collins: Democrats feared women would vote for more socially progressive Republicans. The liquor industry, afraid of prohibition, also opposed women's suffrage, as did many people in the South, where blacks had been largely disenfranchised since Reconstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1918, after much cajoling and picketing by suffragists, President Woodrow Wilson changed his mind and backed the amendment. The next year, both houses of Congress voted to amend the Constitution. Suffrage advocates predicted quick ratification by the states. (By 1919, 28 states permitted women to vote, at least for President.) Within a little more than a year, 35 of the required 36 states had voted for ratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last stand for anti-suffragists was in Tennessee in the summer of 1920. Their showdown in the State Legislature became known as the \"War of the Roses.\" (Pro-amendment forces sported yellow roses; the antis wore red.)\n",
      "\n",
      "After two roll calls, the vote was still tied, 48-48. On the third, Harry T. Burn, a Republican and, at 24, the youngest member of the legislature. switched sides. He was wearing a red rose but voted for ratification because he had received a letter from his mother that read, in part: \"Hurrah and vote for suffrage! Don't keep them in doubt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Burn said later: \"I know that a mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification. I appreciated the fact that an opportunity such as seldom comes to mortal man-to free 17,000,000 women from political slavery-was mine.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But newly enfranchised women voted in much smaller numbers than men. \"Women who were adults at that time had been socialized to believe that voting was socially inappropriate for women,\" says Susan J. Carroll, senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political and social change sought by suffragists came gradually and not without fits and starts. An Equal Rights Amendment, stipulating equal treatment of the sexes under the law, was passed by Congress and sent to the states in 1972, but later failed after being ratified by only 35 of the necessary 38 states.\n",

      "In our wired world, technology moves at a laser-fast pace. Every day, a new gadget arrives and promises to bring us the future, today. In the race for faster computers and more-powerful gadgets, it's easy to forget about yesterday's high-tech wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, used computers and gadgets end up in landfills across the country. Each year, we throw away 12 million computers. And that is not good news for the environment. To make our gadgets work, many of them use materials like lead and mercury. When mercury and lead end up in a landfill, they spread poisons into the earth, water, and air for miles around. This is called e-waste-and it's becoming a big pollution problem around the world.\n",

      "Turning Old Into New\n",
      "\n",
      "The trick to stopping e-waste is to catch it before it gets into the landfill. That's why some seventh-grade students at a school in Michigan organized a computer drop-off event. They put up posters and spread the word around the town, telling people to bring out their old computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the people got the message. They dropped off dozens of old computers, \n",

      "monitors, and printers at the school. Craig Greshaw, the school's computer teacher who helped organize the event, believes that knowing about computers goes beyond surfing the Web. \"Part of that is learning about the chemicals inside the computers and what needs to be done with them to keep them safe,\" he told the town newspaper during the recycling drive. With their school gym filled with old computers, the students were ready for the next step in cleaning up the high-tech trash: turning old computers into new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's where companies like RePC step in. The Seattle company takes e-waste and turns it into e-gold. \"Almost all of the parts of a computer can be reused or recycled,\" says Mark Dabek, owner of RePC. Any computer parts that can't be reused or sold get recycled in a way that won't hurt the environment. \"The circuit boards are sent to a circuit board recycler that chops them and sends them to a facility with a very, very hot furnace called 'the reactor,'\" Dabek says. After the computer parts are safely crushed and burned, their raw materials can be reused to make everything from appliances to office buildings.\n",

      "A lot of people, actually. Places like schools and community centers are often short on cash, but need computers to help them get things done. Robert Sterling, a computer teacher at a high school in California, uses computers donated from local businesses to motivate students and teach them about recycling. \"If kids learn to recycle everything,\" says Sterling, \"they will set a good example for some of the older people who are not in the habit yet of recycling every day.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Ellie Lammer wasn't trying to spark a revolt, she just wanted a haircut. That was in the fall of 1997. Ellie was 11 years old at the time, and she was getting her tresses trimmed in her hometown of Berkeley, California. When Ellie and her mom returned to their car, they found a parking ticket stuck to the windshield. It didn't seem possible: Less than an hour earlier, Ellie had pumped an hour's worth of coins into the meter. But now the needle was at zero, and Ellie's mom owed $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling cheated, Ellie dropped another nickel in the meter and twisted the knob. The needle clicked over to the four-minute mark. Ellie stared at her watch while her mom watched the meter. Less than three minutes later, all of the time had expired. There it was: proof that they'd been cheated. The city tore up the ticket when Ellie's mom complained about the meter.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the experience left Ellie wondering how many other meters were inaccurate. Six months later, she decided to find out. She'd been looking around for a good science-fair project?and that meter in Berkeley still bothered her. So armed with a bag of nickels and a stopwatch, she hit the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellie didn't have the time or money to test every meter, so she focused on a sample of 50 meters located in different parts of the city. To avoid inconveniencing motorists, she did her research after 6 P.M. and on Sundays, when the meters were not in use. She put in eight minutes' worth of nickels in each meter, then measured how much time it really gave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results were not pretty. Ellie's findings suggested that more than nine out of every ten meters in the city were inaccurate?and that every fourth parking meter was running out of time too quickly. With 3,600 parking meters in the city, that meant a lot of undeserved tickets. As Ellie wrote in her science-project report, \"I learned which meters cheat you and which meters cheat the City of Berkeley. But I learned that almost all meters cheat someone, so beware.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the science fair rolled around, Ellie presented her findings with computer-generated charts and graphs. Her classmates weren't very interested in her project. \"It's not like they have to drive a car or put money in a parking meter,\" she explains. But her project was a huge hit with parents. More than 50 of them lined up that night to share their own parking-meter horror stories with Ellie.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, word about Ellie's meter project spread fast. Within a few weeks, Ellie got a call from local politician Diane Woolley. At the time, Berkeley was considering replacing its meters with more accurate digital ones. Ellie shared her findings at city hall, and the politicians were impressed. \"We don't get reports this thorough when we pay consultants hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" one remarked. Based on Ellie's study, they decided to purchase 2,000 new meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The California state legislature also decided to crack down on cheater meters. After Ellie presented her findings, they enacted \"Lammer's Law,\" which requires California's 26 counties to test the accuracy of parking meters. Any meter found to be inaccurate must be fixed or dismantled.\n",
      "\n",
      "California Governor Pete Wilson signed the law on November 1, 1998. At the time, he commented, \"Ellie's ingenuity and dedication has earned her the gratitude of those Californians who've dug through their purses and pockets in search of exact change to feed the meters, only to return to find their cars bearing the dreaded green envelope of a parking ticket.\"\n",

      "Ellie became a celebrity. She was in newspapers all over the country and featured on local television news during the summer and fall of 1998. CNN did a story about her. She was even a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. \"It was kind of a weird moment of being a celebrity,\" she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellie, who's now an eighth-grader at Martin Luther King Middle School, is proud of the work she's done. But she doesn't see meter monitoring as her life's work: \"Right now I don't mind being known as the parking-meter girl, but I'm sure that later in life I'll want something different.\"\n",

      "Doorway to America\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "by Bill Walter\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For such an important place, Ellis Island did not start out as much. Named after Samuel Ellis, the 27-acre knot of an island barely stuck out of the water at high tide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellis Island became important to millions of immigrants in 1892, however, when the U.S. government converted it to an immigration station. Between 1892 and 1954, the island became?for more than 17 million souls?the doorway to America .\n",
      "\n",
      "As you will see in their own words below, America offered immigrants more than just opportunity. You also will see that the \"the land of the free\" was not so free to everyone, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Escaping to America\n",
      "\n",
      "The closing years of the 19th century were an oppressive time in many eastern and southern European nations. In such countries as Russia, Poland, and Armenia , millions of families were suffering. Wars, famines, and pogroms (organized massacres of Jews and other minorities) caused millions of people to flee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ida Mouradjian fled to America from Armenia to escape annihilation by the Turkish government:\n",
      "\n",
      "They [the Turks] would displace every Armenian out of their own homes, out of their own towns and drive them into the Syrian Desert. The idea was to get every Armenian there and by the time they got there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not all were running from the horrors of violence or poverty. Some, like Theodore Lubik from the Ukraine, wanted to avoid the military draft and simply saw the U.S. as a great opportunity:\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend of mine, he had gone to America . He came to Europe once on a visit...He looked just like a governor?horses, wagon, dressed fine, giving his pocket change to us. He gave me ten cents or a quarter?that was big money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard Time Traveling\n",
      "\n",
      "In these times of turmoil, one could not easily move to the U.S. The trials of getting to Ellis Island were often life-threatening in themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, many immigrants had to contend with border guards, thieves, and crooked immigration agents. But it was the trip across the Atlantic that immigrants tended to remember most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crammed into poorly ventilated sleeping areas or cabins below deck, immigrants?many of whom had never seen the sea before?often suffered rough crossings. Vera Gauditsa, pregnant during her crossing from Czechoslovakia , remembered the torture of seasickness:\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tough, but on the boat I was very sick. I thought the child wanted to be born right then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a cabin, but in the cabin was nothing. You had to go through the whole boat to get to the showers and a toilet. So imagine when you are sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But upon seeing their destination, most immigrants?like Sarah Asher from Russia ?forgot about sickness and thought only of a bright future:\n",
      "\n",
      "About four or five o'clock in the morning we all got up. The sunshine started and what do we see? The Statue of Liberty !\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, she was beautiful with the early-morning light. Everybody was crying. Beautiful colors, the greenish-like water ? and so big. We could see New York already, with the big buildings and everything . . . There was a house where the boat stopped but only the Americans were able to go out, but we foreigners remained. Our boat moved further, and that was when we realized we were going to Ellis Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuck at the Door\n",
      "\n",
      "Having to wait while first- and second-class passengers got off the boat, many immigrants began to realize that their troubles were not over.\n",
      "\n",
      "After docking at Manhattan Island, immigrants in steerage were shipped by barge to Ellis Island, to go through examinations. On the island, the immigrants were guided into holding pens in the Great Hall. Irene Zambelli, from Greece , recalled the routine:\n",
      "\n",
      "There were little gates, the same as you go [through] to the subways . . . The first gate we [Irene and her cousin] passed they asked what we were to one another. Then we came to the next gate and they asked us how much was two and two, and four and four. We answered and went to the next gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting Back the Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of immigrants increased over the years, peaking at 1,285,349 in 1907. U.S. officials grew concerned. They saw the growing numbers as a threat to American workers. The officials were afraid the foreigners would take away wages and jobs. As a result, the entrance examinations were made tougher. They included a medical exam and a literacy test. An immigrant who failed one of these tests faced deportation (being sent back) to his or her native country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the examinations, the medical exam seemed to cause immigrants the most concern, recalled Catherine Bolinski, who came from Poland :\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned your eye[lid] over ? I had to blink a couple of times that way. I'll never forget it. They looked at your throat and to see if you had any rashes on your body. They found things wrong with some people. They sent them back, after they [had] sold everything to come here, so they were crying, they felt very bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of being deported was terrifying. Fannie Kligerman, who escaped from Russia with her family, remembered the fear:\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my brothers had something wrong with him. It was a sty. It left a funny thing and they put him aside. And they told us that if there was anything wrong with him, he'd have to go back to Europe. Oh, it was frightening. My father said, \"I'm not going on without the children. We will all go back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charting America's Course\n",
      "\n",
      "Only three percent of those who arrived at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954 were turned away. By 1924, however, the government changed its policy. It slammed shut the \"open door\" that had allowed so many millions to flock to the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1924 set a quota of 164,000 immigrants per year. By 1954, Ellis Island had been shut down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for those who had passed through, America was truly a land of opportunity?despite often-severe hardships. Settling throughout the U.S., immigrants such as composer Irving Berlin, football coach Knute Rockne, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter added to America 's strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having escaped from Russia, Arnold Weiss voiced the determination and hope of the immigrants who passed through Ellis Island:\n",
      "\n",
      "From the whole story of what I went through in all my years ? and some of it wasn't very pleasant? I still love this country. I love this country in spite of everything.\n",

      "The Sharebots\n",
      "\n",
      "by CARL ZIMMER\n",
      "\n",
      "When robots go to kindergarten in Maja Matari's lab, they learn an important lesson about how to get along in robot society.\n",
      "\n",
      "NO MAN IS AN ISLAND, and Maja Matari thinks no robot should be either. Matari, a Brandeis University computer scientist, believes robots will do their best work only when they begin to work together. \"How do you get a herd of robots to do something without killing each other?\" she asks. According to Matari, you have to put them in societies and let them learn from one another, just as seagulls and baboons and people do. Matari has already made an impressive start at teaching robots social skills. She has gotten 14 robots to cooperate at once?the biggest gaggle of machines ever to socialize.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Nerd Herd, as Matari calls them, are shoe-box-size machines, each of which has four wheels, two tongs to grab things, and a two-way radio. The radio allows them to triangulate their position with respect to two fixed transmitters as they wander around Matari's lab. It also allows them to broadcast their coordinates and other information to their neighbors. Infrared sensors help the robots find things and avoid obstacles; contact-sensitive strips tell them when they've crashed anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      " Each robot is programmed with a handful of what Matari calls behaviors?sets of instructions that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal, like following the robot in front of it. Set one robot on the floor with its wheels turned permanently to the left and program the others to follow, and they will all drive in a circle until their batteries go dead. But Matari can get more interesting actions out of the herd by programming them to alternate among several behaviors. By telling them to home in on a target, to aggregate when they're too far from one another, to disperse when they're too crowded and to avoid collisions at all times, she's been able to get scattered robots to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of birds.\n",
      "\n",
      " More important, the robots can also learn on their own to carry out more complex tasks. One task Matari set for them was to forage for little metal pucks and bring them home to their nest in a corner of the lab. To give the task a natural flavor, Matari gave the robots clocks; at \"night\"they had to go home and rest, and in the \"morning\" they looked for pucks again. In addition to five basic behaviors they could choose from, she endowed them with a sort of prime directive: to maximize their individual point scores. Each time a robot did something right, such as locating a puck, it was automatically rewarded with points; each time it committed a blooper, such as dropping a puck, it lost points.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Matari's Nerd Herd, with the pucks they now pursue collectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " After some random experimentation, the robots soon learned how to forage but not very well, because they tended to interfere with one another in their selfish pursuit of points. \"Why should you ever stop and let someone else go?\" asks Matari. \"It's always in your interest to go but if everybody feels that way, then nobody gets through and they jam up and fight for space.\"To make her creatures more efficient, though, Matari found she didn't have to program them with a God's-eye view of what was good for all robots. She just had to teach each robot to share to let other robots know when it had found a puck, and to listen to other robots in return. \"I put in the impetus to pay attention to what other robots are doing, and to try what other robots are trying, sharing the experience,\" Matari explains. \"If I do some thing that's good and if I say, 'That was really great,' then you may try it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " With this simple social contract, the robots needed only 15 minutes of practice to become altruistic. They would magnanimously announce their discovery of pucks, despite having no way of knowing that this was good for the herd as a whole. At times when two robots lunged for a puck, they would stop and go through an \"After you!\" \"No, after you!\" routine, but eventually they figured out the proper way to yield. With social graces, the robot herd brought home the pucks twice as fast as without.\n",
      "\n",
      " Matari thinks she'll be able to produce more complex robot societies. \"I'm looking at getting specialization in the society so they can say, 'I'll do this, and you do that.' If one of them has a low battery, it may become the messenger that doesn't actually carry things. And I imagine one robot might emerge as a leader because it happens to be the most efficient. But if it stops being efficient, some other robot will take over.\"\n",

      "THE LOST PEOPLE OF MESA VERDE\n",
      "\n",
      "by Elsa Marston\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Anasazi lived peacefully on the mesa for 800 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In the dry land of southwestern Colorado a beautiful plateau rises. It has so many trees that early Spanish explorers called it Mesa Verde, which means \"green table.\"For about eight hundred years Native Americans called the Anasazi lived on this mesa. And then they left. Ever since the cliff houses were first discovered a hundred years ago, scientists and historians have wondered why.\n",
      "\n",
      " Anasazi is a Navajo word meaning \"the ancient ones.\" When they first settled there, around 500 A. D., the Anasazi lived in alcoves in the walls of the high canyons. Later they moved to the level land on top, where they built houses of stone and mud mortar. As time passed, they constructed more elaborate houses, like apartment buildings, with several families living close together.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Anasazi made beautiful pottery, turquoise jewelry, fine sashes of woven hair, and baskets woven tightly enough to hold water. They lived by hunting and by growing corn and squash. Their way of life went on peacefully for several hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      " Then around 1200 A.D. something strange happened, for which the reasons are not quite clear. Most of the people moved from the level plateau back down into alcoves in the cliffs. The move must have made their lives difficult because they had to climb back up to the plateau to do the farming. But it seems the Anasazi planned to stay in the canyon walls, for they soon filled the alcoves with amazing cliff dwellings. \"Cliff Palace,\" the most famous of these, had more than two hundred rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      " For all the hard work that went into building these new homes, the Anasazi did not live in them long. By 1300 A.D. the cliff dwellings were empty. Mesa Verde was deserted and remained a ghost country for almost six hundred years. Were the people driven out of their homes by enemies? No sign of attack or fighting, or even the presence of other tribes, has been found.\n",
      "\n",
      " Archaeologists who have studied the place now believe there are other reasons. Mesa Verde, the beautiful green table, was no longer a good place to live. For one thing, in the second half of the thirteenth century there were long periods of cold, and very little rain fell?or else it came at the wrong time of year. Scientists know this from examining the wood used in the cliff dwellings. The growth rings in trees show good and bad growing seasons. But the people had survived drought and bad weather before, so there must have been another reason.\n",
      "\n",
      " As the population grew, more land on the mesa top had to be farmed in order to feed the people. That meant that trees had to be cut to clear the land and also to use for houses and fuel. Without the forests, the rain began to wash away the mesa top.\n",
      "\n",
      " How do we know about erosion problems that happened about eight hundred years ago? The Anasazi built many low dams across the smaller valleys on the mesa to slow down rain runoff. Even so, good soil washed away, and the people could no longer raise enough food. As the forests dwindled, the animals, already over?hunted, left the mesa for mountainous areas with more trees.\n",
      "\n",
      " And as the mesa \"wore out,\" so did the people. It appears that the Anasazi were not healthy. Scientists can learn a lot about ancient people's health by studying the bones and teeth found in burials. The mesa dwellers had arthritis, and their teeth were worn down by the grit in corn meal, a main part of their diet.\n",
      "\n",
      " As food became scarce, people grew weaker. Not many lived beyond their twenties. Women died very young, and few babies survived. Living so close together in the cliff houses, where everyone was hungry and worried, the people must have suffered from emotional strain. They probably quarreled often.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the end the Anasazi must have given up hope that things would get better. Families packed up and went away. Of course, the \"ancient ones\" did not simply disappear. They moved southeast to another area and mingled with other peoples. After a while their heritage as the people of the Mesa Verde was forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      " In time the trees grew back and the plateau became green once more. But, for the Anasazi it was too late. Although they respected nature and tried to farm wisely, land that was used too hard could not support them forever.\n",
      "\n",
      " Yet in their cliff houses and crafts the \"ancient ones\" left us a superb monument. It is truly one of the most fascinating pictures of America's past.\n",

      "Dorothea Dix: Quiet Crusader\n",
      "\n",
      "by Lucie Germer\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothea Dix was so shy and quiet that it is hard to believe she had such a tremendous impact on nineteenth-century America. Yet almost single-handedly, she transformed the way people with mental illness were treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothea was born in Maine in 1802 to a neglectful father and a mother who had trouble coping with daily activities. She ran away at the age of twelve to live with her grandmother, a cold, inflexible woman who nevertheless taught her the importance of doing her duty, as well as the organizational skills to help her do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothea grew into an attractive woman, with blue-gray eyes, wavy brown hair, and a rich, low speaking voice. As a young adult, she spent her time teaching, writing books for children, and fighting the effect of tuberculosis. Despite her poor health, by age thirty-nine, she had saved enough money so that she had no financial worries. Afraid that her health was too poor for her to continue teaching, she looked forward to a lonely, unfulfilling life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a friend suggested that she teach a Sunday school class for women in a Massachusetts jail. It would be useful without overtaxing her. On her first day, she discovered that among the inmates were several mentally ill women. They were anxious to hear what she had to say, but she found it impossible to teach them because the room was unheated. Dix, angry at this neglect on the part of the authorities, asked noted humanitarian Samuel Howe for his help in taking the case to court. The court ordered the authorities to install a wood stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sparked Dix's interest in the ways mentally ill people were treated. Encouraged by Howe and education reformer Horace Mann, she spent two years visiting every asylum, almshouse, and jail in Massachusetts, quietly taking notes on the conditions. Her grandmother had trained her to be thorough, and the training paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dix put her findings into a memorial (a report) that Howe presented to the Massachusetts legislature: \"I tell what I have seen... [I]nsane persons confined...in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens; chained, naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The memorial caused an uproar: What kind of woman would be interested in such a subject and insist on discussing it in public? Gradually, the personal attacks abated, primarily because Dix's research had been so thorough and her results were so complete that no one could argue with them. Howe was able to push a bill through the Massachusetts legislature to enlarge the state asylum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dix spent the next few years systematically studying conditions and getting legislation passed in other states. Her health did not keep her from putting in long hours of hard work and travel. First, she studied the psychological and legal views of mental illness and its treatment. Before she went into a state, she examined local laws and previous proposals for change. Then she visited every institution, small or large, and met with administrators, politicians, and private citizens. She put all this information together in a memorial that was presented to the legislature. She also wrote newspaper articles to inform the public of her findings. By this time, she knew what kind of opposition to expect, and she could help deflect it by appealing to the citizens' sense of pride or desire for economy. She also met privately with small groups of politicians to answer their questions and try to persuade them to come around to her point of view. She was usually successful, and public institutions to house and treat people with mental illness were established.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, that success did not carry over to her next goal: national legislation to improve the living conditions for people with mental illness. In the 1850s, Congress passed a bill setting aside land for the establishment of national hospitals for those with mental illness, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill on constitutional grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dix was shattered. Her health, which had been surprisingly good during her struggles, took a turn for the worse, and doctors recommended she take a long voyage. Dix was unable to relax, however, and her vacation turned into a marathon journey through Europe, as she examined the living conditions of mentally ill people in each place she visited. She spoke with doctors, government officials, and even the pope, pleading for humanitarian treatment for those who were mentally ill. She went as far east as Constantinople (now Istanbul) in Turkey and as far north as St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) in Russia. She was greeted respectfully everywhere she went, and many of her recommendations were followed.\n",

      "She returned to the United States in 1857 and was appointed superintendent of women nurses during the Civil War. Dix was the only woman to hold an official position in the U.S. government during the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the war, Dix continued her work on behalf of mentally ill people both in the United States and abroad. She died in 1887 at the age of eighty-five. Between 1841, when she began her crusade, and the year she died, thirty-two new hospitals for those who were mentally ill were built, most of them directly because she had brought the problem to the attention of people in power. Several other institutions in Canada and Europe, and even two in Japan, were established because of her influence. She also left a legacy of concern: No longer was mental illness treated as a crime, and her enlightened and tireless work led to more humane living conditions for people with mental illness.\n",

      "The Oregon Trail\n",
      "\n",
      " Americans have long been thought of as a restless group of people. They seem to have always been on the move, searching for a better place to live. From America's first colonies small groups of people uprooted themselves, migrating westward to look for better farmland. They built pioneer roads, or trails, such as the Cumberland Road that led into the Ohio Valley, and the Genesee Road that led across New York to the shores of Lake Erie. Many of these roads and trails have disappeared. Others can still be traced, revealing artifacts along the way that help us to recreate their story.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Oregon Trail is one of these trails. Even today you can retrace its path, walking beside wagon ruts that were gouged almost a century and a half ago. The Oregon Trail was different from the earlier trails and roads that had crossed the Appalachian Mountains in the East. It was longer and more difficult than most pioneers had experienced. Unlike the eastern trails, the Oregon Trail crossed nearly 2,000 miles of unfamiliar prairie, desert, and mountainous regions. There were no settlements along the way that could offer friendly hospitality, and emigrants couldn't scout out their new homeland before they moved there. Oregon Country was so far away, it took from four to six months to get there. When people moved there, they moved to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      " The story of the Oregon Trail and the people who used it begins when the trail was an ancient Indian footpath used by explorers and fur traders. Independence, Missouri, was the frontier town that served as the starting place. The trail wound westward, following the banks of the Platte, North Platte, and Snake Rivers. It crossed the Rockies through the South Pass, crossed the Blue Mountains further north, and ended in Oregon Country at a place called The Dalles. From The Dalles, anyone continuing on to the Williamette Valley floated down the Columbia River. Up until the mid-1830s, no wagon had ever made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      " It is difficult for us to imagine Oregon Country as it was a century and a half ago. A vast wilderness that stretched from the crest of the Rockies to the Pacific coast, it included the present states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The area was inhabited by several tribes of Indians, including the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Nez Perce. There were some trappers and traders in the region, but to most, the area was too far away and too strange for them to consider settling there.\n",
      "\n",
      " President Thomas Jefferson was the first to actively encourage exploration of Oregon Country. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, he sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark into the area to seek a trade route to the Pacific. Jefferson knew that their explorations would help the United States strengthen its claim to the Pacific Northwest.\n",
      "\n",
      " It is important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both Great Britain and the United States occupied the Pacific Northwest. Great Britain already had a strong claim to the land that was to become Canada, and the Hudson's Bay Company had many fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest. There were American fur trading posts as well, such as the American Fur Company organized by John Jacob Astor in 1808.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 1818, Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that allowed both countries to occupy the area, but it was not until the 1830s that Americans began moving in. Missionaries, such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, were among the first settlers. When people learned that the Whitmans had journeyed successfully over the Oregon Trail in 1836, they began to think differently about Oregon Country. The fact that a woman had made the journey safely, and that the Whitmans had traveled with a wagon, encouraged others to think that they could make the journey, too.\n",
      "\n",
      " In fact, when Dr. Whitman returned East in 1842 to help promote his missionary work, he found many people who were eager to travel to Oregon Country. In 1843, some 1,000 people and 2,000 animals joined Dr. Whitman and a surveyor named Jesse Applegate as they led a wagon train over the Oregon Trail. The \"great migration\" ? one of the greatest migrations in recorded history ? had begun.\n",
      "\n",
      " Why were so many people going to Oregon Country? Some said they had Oregon fever, a \"disease\" that made them restless, hungry for new land, and eager for adventure. But why were they going all the way to Oregon Country? One very important reason was that the United States government was encouraging them to do so. Since Thomas Jefferson's presidency, our government had come a long way toward believing that the United States should stretch from coast to coast. If Americans were to settle the Oregon Country in large numbers, our claim to the land would be strengthened.\n",
      "\n",
      " One man in particular wrote reports about the Oregon Country that were designed to make people want to go there. His name was John Charles Fremont (1813-90). He was a soldier, explorer and political leader who, in 1838, was asked to be the chief assistant in mapping the upper waters of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He wrote very detailed descriptions of his explorations, and his reports were reprinted and read by many people. It was Fremont who wrote guidebooks for emigrants who were encouraged to settle in Oregon Country and help wrest it from British control.\n",
      "\n",
      " As Americans began pouring into the Williamette River valley in the 1840s, a dispute between Great Britain and the United States almost caused a war. The biggest disagreement was over the northern boundary of the Oregon Country. The British wanted the boundary to be on the north bank of the Columbia River. The Americans wanted it further north on the 54th Parallel. After careful negotiations, war was prevented when the two countries signed the Oregon Treaty of 1846. They agreed to compromise, placing the boundary on the 49th Parallel extending to Puget sound and leaving Vancouver Island as a part of Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Oregon Treaty gave the United States undisputed claim to the Pacific Northwest, encouraging even more emigrants to move west. By the 1850s, the Oregon Trail had become a series of parallel wagon ruts that could be seen even in solid rock. Oregon Country officially became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1859, the state of Oregon was created and admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. Twenty years earlier the area had been an unknown wilderness!\n",
      "\n",
      " What was it like to travel on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s? Fortunately there are many accounts that have survived, written by the people who used the trail and who wanted to preserve their experiences for later generations. The story of the Sager children was preserved by three of the Sager girls who survived. Diaries, such as the one handed down to Jean Burroughs, provide eyewitness accounts of the daily travel. When we read these accounts, we can easily imagine the hardship, the anxiety, and the excitement the emigrants must have experienced.\n",
      "\n",
      " According to several historians, at least 30,000 emigrants died on the Oregon Trail between 1843 and 1859. You might say that there is an average of one grave for every 100 yards of trail from the Missouri River to the Williamette River! Why did so many people die? Cholera, a disease that spreads when there are filthy conditions caused by garbage and sewage, claimed thousands of lives. Emigrants passed through, and sometimes camped near, the refuse left by earlier wagon trains. Other diseases caused people to die, but cholera was probably the most common.\n",
      "\n",
      " Accident was another common cause of death. Children often hurt themselves as the wagons rolled along. Doctors were not always available, and even when they were they often lacked necessary supplies. Most of the emigrants were simply not prepared for the difficult journey ahead, and they were careless.\n",
      "\n",
      " There were some problems as the emigrants passed through Indian territory. Indian attacks usually took the form of raids on the livestock, but few people were ever killed. The Indians owned much of the land on both sides of the Oregon Trail, and the emigrants were trespassing. Some tribal leaders demanded payment as the wagon trains rolled through, and, if the emigrants cooperated, there was no further trouble. In other instances, the Indians made a surprise attack, took livestock, and left the wagons unharmed.\n",
      "\n",
      " It would be several years later, in the 1860s, when the Indians would finally realize that their homelands had been lost forever. Tribal chiefs, such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse, both of the Oglala Sioux, devoted their lives to trying to save their homelands and people. But the idea that the United States should stretch from coast to coast had already taken hold. The Oregon Trail, no longer just a footpath, had opened the way to the West.\n",

      "Nettie's Big Fish\n",
      "\n",
      "by Jean M. Burroughs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " \"Here's your baited hook and line, Daughter. See what you can land. Every family in our wagon train needs fresh fish for supper.\" Nettie Emory's father stood by her on the banks of the North Platte River late one evening in June, 1863. \"And mind you keep your shoes on this time, Pet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Nettie drew down the corners of her mouth in disappointment. She'd been counting on cool water and squishy mud to cool her feet, hot and sweaty from her high?topped, laced shoes. She knew her father was referring to the time she had wandered from camp to gather \"yellow roses,\"the enticing blooms of prickly pear cactus. Stepping on dozens of stickers in her bare feet was a painful experience she would never forget. She'd never seen cactus before so how was she supposed to know?\n",
      "\n",
      " Now, holding her line and hook high, Nettie edged closer to the water, hoping against hope she would catch a fish. Otherwise, it was going to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again. After several weeks on the Oregon Trail, their supply of meat was used up. Even wild game had been scarce, and they had not yet reached the plentiful buffalo on the plains. She was certainly tired of the monotonous diet.\n",
      "\n",
      " Nettie's father called back over his shoulder. \"Remember there's quicksand and sinkholes. Test the ground before you step. Stay close to me. Good luck, Blackie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Nettie grinned at her father's use of her nickname, given because of her unusually dark hair and eyes. Her French mother preferred Minette, but had agreed to the shortened form of Nettie. An only child, the nine?year?old girl answered to all the names that her loving parents called her. She was proud that her father had been chosen wagon master to lead the train over the plains and mountains to faraway Oregon. Perhaps if she caught a fish, he'd be proud of her too, just as he was when she drove the ox team safely during her mother's illness. She wanted to help him during this difficult journey as much as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      " She watched him and the other men choose places to cast their lines at the water's edge. Some waded into the shallows near the sand islands in the river where the current was running swifter because of a recent rain. Through a thicket of willows she edged closer to where a quiet pool had formed under the tree roots. Just the place for a fish to hide, she thought. She quietly dropped her hook, watching it sink to the bottom. Then she waited, swinging her sun-bonnet strings back and forth to brush off the gnats and mosquitoes that hummed around her face.\n",
      "\n",
      " She waited. She waited, but no fish rose to her bait. As she slid down the riverbank she kept her father's black hat in sight. Her line drifted faster with the fresh current. Fishing can be tiresome, she fretted, but it's better than just watching the trail from the back of our crowded wagon.\n",
      "\n",
      " None of the men had caught a fish so far. She squinted at the sun, well above the horizon of the summer sky. There's plenty of time before supper fires are lighted, she thought. With her left hand she slapped at a pesky mosquito again; her right hand tightened its grip on the pole. A sudden jerk on the line caused her to stumble forward to keep her balance. A bite! A bite! The pull on her line was steady and strong. She lifted her pole and it bent forward. It surely must be a big one.\n",
      "\n",
      " And it was a big one, big enough to pull Nettie dangerously toward the water. Her breath came in gasps. She dug in the heels of her sturdy shoes, glad now that she wasn't barefoot. She couldn't back up because the end of the line was moving fast toward the center of the river. She could no longer see her father's hat because of the tall rushes growing at water's edge.\n",
      "\n",
      " Grimly, she held on. Her feet were already soaked. Would her next step be into quicksand? The line moved downstream, dragging Nettie into ankle?deep, then knee?deep water. She was excited about the catch and dared not let go. She also was becoming a little frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Papa, Papa, I've got a big one!\" she cried. \"It's pulling me into the river!\" Her voice was lost in the evening breeze that stirred the rushes. \"Papa, can't you hear me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      " How much longer could she hold on? She used all her strength. Her shoulders ached from the strain. \"Help! Help!\" she shouted to anyone who might hear her. She turned her body so that the line wrapped around her hips. Her legs sank deeper into the sandy bottom. Muddy water billowed out her full skirt. \"I'm like an umbrella,\" she laughed to herself. \"Now maybe they'll see me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Fresh fish or dry salt bacon: the very thought gave her extra endurance. Not just for her own family, but the other wagon people who were also hungry for a change in diet. Drawing a deeper breath, she called hoarsely, \"Save me! Save my fish!\"\n",
      "\n",
      " An answering shout gave her courage. She heard footsteps splashing nearer. \"Blackie, hold on. Pull back,\" called her father. Other men dropped their poles and ran to help. Josiah Emory placed his body in front of his little girl's, grabbing the line with his strong hands. Nettie clung to the pole while her father slowly, steadily, pulled in the line. Soon a flashing, grey body flapped in and out of the water. \"It's a big catfish, Blackie, a really huge one. Good girl! I'm proud of you.\" Only then did Nettie let go. He lifted the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight. Indeed, it was a huge fish. Her father guessed it was over three feet long and more than twenty-five pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      " Sloshing back to the wagon, muddy and exhausted, Nettie wondered what her mother would say. Her dress and petticoats were caked with red mud. Her shoes squished water through the laces. Now perhaps I can go barefoot until my shoes dry, she thought. She hoped her mother would be so glad over the fish that she wouldn't scold.\n",
      "\n",
      " News of Nettie's big catch spread among the wagons. A hungry crowd gathered to watch while Nettie's father dressed the fish. \"Build up the fire,\" he said. \"We'll all feast tonight. No ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " \"And biscuits and syrup instead of corn bread?\" Nettie asked her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Yes, Minette. All the biscuits and syrup and fish you can eat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Nettie grinned a happy, tired grin. \"I'll always remember how that fish almost swam away with me. I am going to write about it in my diary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A Note from the Author:\n",
      "\n",
      " This is a true story. A copy of Nettie Emory's diary was given to me by her granddaughter. From Nettie's entries about her trip on the Oregon Trail, written in 1863, I have retold her exciting adventure with the big fish. Of course I used imaginary conversation and descriptions. This is what Nettie wrote in her diary:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"I was allowed to fish with the men in the Missouri River. Suddenly a fish took my bait, and I was pulled to the water's edge. My father heard my call for help. He began to run when he saw me splashing in the water. Other men helped him land the fish while I went back to the wagon to dry out. The fish was over three feet long and weighed about 25 pounds. I was the only one who caught a fish that day but we shared it with the others.\"\n",

'' otherwise , she warn , `` we be determine to foment a rebellion , and will not hold ourselves bind by any law in which we have no voice or representation . '' that summer , the declaration of independence proclaim that all men be create equal but say nothing of woman 's equality . it would take another 144 year before the u.s. constitution be amend , give woman the right to vote in every state . that 19th amendment say simply : `` the right of citizen of the unite state to vote shall not be deny or abridge by the unite state or by any state on account of sex .

'' stanton be join in her campaign by susan b. anthony , sojourner truth , lucretia mott , and other crusader who would become icon of the woman 's movement . some be militant . many be meet with verbal abuse and even violence . already active in the antislavery movement and temperance campaign ( which urge abstinence from alcohol ) , woman often enlist in the fight for vote right too . wyoming be first they stag demonstration , engage in civil disobedience , begin legal challenge , and press their case state by state . in 1869 , the wyoming territory give woman the vote , with the first permanent suffrage law in the nation . ( `` it make sense that a place like wyoming would embrace woman 's right , '' gail collins of the new york time write in her book america 's woman . `` with very few woman around , there be no danger that they could impose their will on the male majority .

( in the south , black woman and men would be keep off voter roll in large number until 1965 , after passage of the vote right act . ) but newly enfranchise woman vote in much smaller number than men . `` woman who be adult at that time have be socialize to believe that vote be socially inappropriate for woman , '' say susan j. carroll , senior scholar at the center for american woman and politics . the political and social change seek by suffragist come gradually and not without fit and start . an equal right amendment , stipulate equal treatment of the sex under the law , be pas by congress and send to the state in 1972 , but later fail after be ratify by only 35 of the necessary 38 state . in 1980 , however , woman surpass men for the first time in turnout for a presidential election . since then , there have also be a substantial rise in the number of woman run for and hold political office . vc176436 from the new york time upfront magazine , september 5 , 2005 issue .\n",

      "the sharebots by carl zimmer when robot go to kindergarten in maja matari 's lab , they learn an important lesson about how to get along in robot society . no man be an island , and maja matari think no robot should be either . matari , a brandeis university computer scientist , believe robot will do their best work only when they begin to work together . `` how do you get a herd of robot to do something without kill each other ? '' she ask . accord to matari , you have to put them in society and let them learn from one another , just a seagull and baboon and people do . matari have already make an impressive start at teach robot social skill . she have get 14 robot to cooperate at once ? the biggest gaggle of machine ever to socialize . the nerd herd , a matari call them , be shoe-box-size machine , each of which have four wheel , two tongs to grab thing , and a two-way radio . the radio allow them to triangulate their position with respect to two fix transmitter a they wander around matari 's lab . it also allow them to broadcast their coordinate and other information to their neighbor . infrared sensor help the robot find thing and avoid obstacle ; contact-sensitive strip tell them when they 've crash anyway . each robot be program with a handful of what matari call behavior ? set of instruction that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal , like follow the robot in front of it . set one robot on the floor with it wheel turn permanently to the leave and program the others to follow , and they will all drive in a circle until their battery go dead . but matari can get more interest action out of the herd by program them to alternate among several behavior . by tell them to home in on a target , to aggregate when they 're too far from one another , to disperse when they 're too crowd and to avoid collision at all time , she 's be able to get scatter robot to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of bird . more important , the robot can also learn on their own to carry out more complex task . one task matari set for them be to forage for little metal puck and bring them home to their nest in a corner of the lab . to give the task a natural flavor , matari give the robot clock ; at `` night '' they have to go home and rest , and in the `` morning '' they look for puck again . in addition to five basic behavior they could choose from , she endow them with a sort of prime directive : to maximize their individual point score . each time a robot do something right , such a locate a puck , it be automatically reward with point ; each time it commit a blooper , such a drop a puck , it lose point . matari 's nerd herd , with the puck they now pursue collectively . after some random experimentation , the robot soon learn how to forage but not very well , because they tend to interfere with one another in their selfish pursuit of point . `` why should you ever stop and let someone else go ? '' ask matari . `` it 's always in your interest to go but if everybody feel that way , then nobody get through and they jam up and fight for space . `` to make her creature more efficient , though , matari find she do n't have to program them with a god's-eye view of what be good for all robot . she just have to teach each robot to share to let other robot know when it have find a puck , and to listen to other robot in return . `` i put in the impetus to pay attention to what other robot be do , and to try what other robot be try , share the experience , '' matari explain . `` if i do some thing that 's good and if i say , 'that be really great , ' then you may try it . '' with this simple social contract , the robot need only 15 minute of practice to become altruistic . they would magnanimously announce their discovery of puck , despite have no way of know that this be good for the herd a a whole . at time when two robot lunge for a puck , they would stop and go through an `` after you ! '' `` no , after you ! '' routine , but eventually they figure out the proper way to yield . with social grace , the robot herd bring home the puck twice a fast a without . matari think she 'll be able to produce more complex robot society . `` i 'm look at get specialization in the society so they can say , 'i 'll do this , and you do that . ' if one of them have a low battery , it may become the messenger that do n't actually carry thing . and i imagine one robot might emerge a a leader because it happen to be the most efficient . but if it stop be efficient , some other robot will take over .

      "the lose people of mesa verde by elsa marston the anasazi live peacefully on the mesa for 800 year . then they disappear . in the dry land of southwestern colorado a beautiful plateau rise . it have so many tree that early spanish explorer call it mesa verde , which mean `` green table . `` for about eight hundred year native american call the anasazi live on this mesa . and then they leave . ever since the cliff house be first discover a hundred year ago , scientist and historian have wonder why . anasazi be a navajo word mean `` the ancient one . '' when they first settle there , around 500 a. d. , the anasazi live in alcove in the wall of the high canyon . later they move to the level land on top , where they build house of stone and mud mortar . a time pas , they construct more elaborate house , like apartment build , with several family live close together . the anasazi make beautiful pottery , turquoise jewelry , fine sash of weave hair , and basket weave tightly enough to hold water . they live by hunt and by grow corn and squash . their way of life go on peacefully for several hundred year . then around 1200 a.d. something strange happen , for which the reason be not quite clear . most of the people move from the level plateau back down into alcove in the cliff . the move must have make their live difficult because they have to climb back up to the plateau to do the farm . but it seem the anasazi plan to stay in the canyon wall , for they soon fill the alcove with amaze cliff dwell . `` cliff palace , '' the most famous of these , have more than two hundred room . for all the hard work that go into build these new home , the anasazi do not live in them long . by 1300 a.d. the cliff dwell be empty . mesa verde be desert and remain a ghost country for almost six hundred year . be the people drive out of their home by enemy ? no sign of attack or fight , or even the presence of other tribe , have be find . archaeologist who have study the place now believe there be other reason . mesa verde , the beautiful green table , be no longer a good place to live . for one thing , in the second half of the thirteenth century there be long period of cold , and very little rain fell ? or else it come at the wrong time of year . scientist know this from examine the wood use in the cliff dwell . the growth ring in tree show good and bad grow season . but the people have survive drought and bad weather before , so there must have be another reason . a the population grow , more land on the mesa top have to be farm in order to fee the people . that mean that tree have to be cut to clear the land and also to use for house and fuel . without the forest , the rain begin to wash away the mesa top . how do we know about erosion problem that happen about eight hundred year ago ? the anasazi build many low dam across the smaller valley on the mesa to slow down rain runoff . even so , good soil wash away , and the people could no longer raise enough food . a the forest dwindle , the animal , already over ? hunt , leave the mesa for mountainous area with more tree . and a the mesa `` wear out , '' so do the people . it appear that the anasazi be not healthy . scientist can learn a lot about ancient people 's health by study the bone and teeth find in burial . the mesa dweller have arthritis , and their teeth be wear down by the grit in corn meal , a main part of their diet . a food become scarce , people grow weaker . not many live beyond their twenty . woman die very young , and few baby survive . live so close together in the cliff house , where everyone be hungry and worry , the people must have suffer from emotional strain . they probably quarrel often . in the end the anasazi must have give up hope that thing would get better . family pack up and go away . of course , the `` ancient one '' do not simply disappear . they move southeast to another area and mingle with other people . after a while their heritage a the people of the mesa verde be forget . in time the tree grow back and the plateau become green once more . but , for the anasazi it be too late . although they respect nature and try to farm wisely , land that be use too hard could not support them forever . yet in their cliff house and craft the `` ancient one '' leave u a superb monument . it be truly one of the most fascinate picture of america 's past .\n",

      "the oregon trail american have long be think of a a restless group of people . they seem to have always be on the move , search for a better place to live . from america 's first colony small group of people uproot themselves , migrate westward to look for better farmland . they build pioneer road , or trail , such a the cumberland road that lead into the ohio valley , and the genesee road that lead across new york to the shore of lake erie . many of these road and trail have disappear . others can still be trace , reveal artifact along the way that help u to recreate their story . the oregon trail be one of these trail . even today you can retrace it path , walk beside wagon rut that be gouge almost a century and a half ago . the oregon trail be different from the earlier trail and road that have cross the appalachian mountain in the east . it be longer and more difficult than most pioneer have experience . unlike the eastern trail , the oregon trail cross nearly 2,000 mile of unfamiliar prairie , desert , and mountainous region . there be no settlement along the way that could offer friendly hospitality , and emigrant could n't scout out their new homeland before they move there . oregon country be so far away , it take from four to six month to get there . when people move there , they move to stay . the story of the oregon trail and the people who use it begin when the trail be an ancient indian footpath use by explorer and fur trader . independence , missouri , be the frontier town that serve a the start place . the trail wind westward , follow the bank of the platte , north platte , and snake river . it cross the rockies through the south pas , cross the blue mountain further north , and end in oregon country at a place call the dalles . from the dalles , anyone continue on to the williamette valley float down the columbia river . up until the mid-1830s , no wagon have ever make the trip . it be difficult for u to imagine oregon country a it be a century and a half ago . a vast wilderness that stretch from the crest of the rockies to the pacific coast , it include the present state of oregon , washington , and idaho . the area be inhabit by several tribe of indian , include the cayuse , umatilla , and nez perce . there be some trapper and trader in the region , but to most , the area be too far away and too strange for them to consider settle there . president thomas jefferson be the first to actively encourage exploration of oregon country . after the louisiana purchase of 1803 , he send meriwether lewis and william clark into the area to seek a trade route to the pacific . jefferson know that their exploration would help the unite state strengthen it claim to the pacific northwest . it be important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both great britain and the unite state occupy the pacific northwest . great britain already have a strong claim to the land that be to become canada , and the hudson 's bay company have many fur trade post in the pacific northwest . there be american fur trade post a well , such a the american fur company organize by john jacob astor in 1808 . in 1818 , great britain and the unite state sign a treaty that allow both country to occupy the area , but it be not until the 1830s that american begin move in . missionary , such a marcus and narcissa whitman , be among the first settler . when people learn that the whitman have journey successfully over the oregon trail in 1836 , they begin to think differently about oregon country . the fact that a woman have make the journey safely , and that the whitman have travel with a wagon , encourage others to think that they could make the journey , too . in fact , when dr. whitman return east in 1842 to help promote his missionary work , he find many people who be eager to travel to oregon country . in 1843 , some 1,000 people and 2,000 animal join dr. whitman and a surveyor name jesse applegate a they lead a wagon train over the oregon trail . the `` great migration '' ? one of the greatest migration in record history ? have begin . why be so many people go to oregon country ? some say they have oregon fever , a `` disease '' that make them restless , hungry for new land , and eager for adventure . but why be they go all the way to oregon country ? one very important reason be that the unite state government be encourage them to do so . since thomas jefferson 's presidency , our government have come a long way toward believe that the unite state should stretch from coast to coast . if american be to settle the oregon country in large number , our claim to the land would be strengthen . one man in particular write report about the oregon country that be design to make people want to go there . his name be john charles fremont ( 1813-90 ) . he be a soldier , explorer and political leader who , in 1838 , be ask to be the chief assistant in map the upper water of the mississippi and missouri river . he write very detail description of his exploration , and his report be reprint and read by many people . it be fremont who write guidebook for emigrant who be encourage to settle in oregon country and help wrest it from british control . a american begin pour into the williamette river valley in the 1840s , a dispute between great britain and the unite state almost cause a war . the biggest disagreement be over the northern boundary of the oregon country . the british want the boundary to be on the north bank of the columbia river . the american want it further north on the 54th parallel . after careful negotiation , war be prevent when the two country sign the oregon treaty of 1846 . they agree to compromise , place the boundary on the 49th parallel extend to puget sound and leave vancouver island a a part of canada . the oregon treaty give the unite state undisputed claim to the pacific northwest , encourage even more emigrant to move west . by the 1850s , the oregon trail have become a series of parallel wagon rut that could be see even in solid rock . oregon country officially become the oregon territory in 1848 . in 1859 , the state of oregon be create and admit to the union a the 33rd state . twenty year earlier the area have be an unknown wilderness ! what be it like to travel on the oregon trail in the 1840s and 1850s ? fortunately there be many account that have survive , write by the people who use the trail and who want to preserve their experience for later generation . the story of the sager child be preserve by three of the sager girl who survive . diary , such a the one hand down to jean burroughs , provide eyewitness account of the daily travel . when we read these account , we can easily imagine the hardship , the anxiety , and the excitement the emigrant must have experience . accord to several historian , at least 30,000 emigrant die on the oregon trail between 1843 and 1859 . you might say that there be an average of one grave for every 100 yard of trail from the missouri river to the williamette river ! why do so many people die ? cholera , a disease that spread when there be filthy condition cause by garbage and sewage , claim thousand of live . emigrant pas through , and sometimes camp near , the refuse leave by earlier wagon train . other disease cause people to die , but cholera be probably the most common . accident be another common cause of death . child often hurt themselves a the wagon roll along . doctor be not always available , and even when they be they often lack necessary supply . most of the emigrant be simply not prepare for the difficult journey ahead , and they be careless . there be some problem a the emigrant pas through indian territory . indian attack usually take the form of raid on the livestock , but few people be ever kill . the indian own much of the land on both side of the oregon trail , and the emigrant be trespass . some tribal leader demand payment a the wagon train roll through , and , if the emigrant cooperate , there be no further trouble . in other instance , the indian make a surprise attack , take livestock , and leave the wagon unharmed . it would be several year later , in the 1860s , when the indian would finally realize that their homeland have be lose forever . tribal chief , such a red cloud and crazy horse , both of the oglala sioux , devote their live to try to save their homeland and people . but the idea that the unite state should stretch from coast to coast have already take hold . the oregon trail , no longer just a footpath , have open the way to the west . from cobblestone 's december , 1981 , issue : the oregon trail .\n"

the law to fish for white shark off the shore of place like the unite state , australia , and south africa . `` have a live , swim white shark let people say , 'wow , this animal be really neat , ' ``

throw away 12 million computer . and that be not good news for the environment . to make our gadget work , many of them use material like lead and mercury . when mercury and lead end up in a landfill , they spread poison into the earth , water , and air for mile around . this be call e-waste-and it 's become a big pollution problem around the world . big problem call for big solution , so adult and kid from dozen of country be work hard to clean up our e-waste . and you can help , too . turn old into new the trick to stop e-waste be to catch it before it get into the landfill . that 's why some seventh-grade student at a school in michigan organize a computer drop-off event . they put up poster and spread the word around the town , tell people to bring out their old computer . and the people get the message . they drop off dozen of old computer , monitor , and printer at the school . craig greshaw , the school 's computer teacher who help organize the event , believe that know about computer go beyond surf the web . `` part of that be learn about the chemical inside the computer and what need to be do with them to keep them safe , `` he tell the town newspaper during the recycle drive . with their school gym fill with old computer , the student be ready for the next step in clean up the high-tech trash : turn old computer into new one . that 's where company like repc step in . the seattle company take e-waste and turn it into e-gold . `` almost all of the part of a computer can be reuse or recycle , `` say mark dabek , owner of repc . any computer part that ca n't be reuse or sell get recycle in a way that wo n't hurt the environment . `` the circuit board be send to a circuit board recycler that chop them and send them to a facility with a very , very hot furnace call 'the reactor , ' `` dabek say . after the computer part be safely crush and burn , their raw material can be reuse to make everything from appliance to office build . sometimes you can

      "forget about travel to africa to go on a safari . if some scientist have their way , people might be able to spot lion and elephant roam the great plain of north america . the great plain lie in the center of north america , extend from the mississippi river to the rocky mountain and from canada to texas . a team of scientist recently propose the bold plan to save endanger animal from extinction in africa . many animal habitat there be disappear . a habitat be the place where a plant or an animal live . just `` plain `` smart supporter of the plan say that relocate the animal to the great plain would help restore the region 's biodiversity ( the variety of different organism find within a geographic region ) closer to what it be before human come along . most modern african animal never live on the great plain . however , some other large animal , such a camel , saber-toothed cat , and mastodon , live there thousand of year ago . a mastodon be a furry , elephant-like creature with long tusk . mastodon and other animal live on the great plain until the last ice age end , about 10,000 year ago . an ice age be a period of time when sheet of ice cover earth . supporter of the project also say that relocate large animal to vast park in the great plain could save hundred of specie in africa and asia that now face extinction . they say the animal could be introduce gradually on private land . eventually , fence animal reserve could be open to tourist . bad idea those against the plan argue that release different specie into new environment can cause destruction . cane toad , for example , bring to forget bury forget block blank_out draw_a_blank forget forget leave about astir approximately about close_to just_about some roughly more_or_less

      "elli island doorway to america by bill walter for such an important place , elli island do not start out a much . name after samuel elli , the 27-acre knot of an island barely stick out of the water at high tide . elli island become important to million of immigrant in 1892 , however , when the u.s. government convert it to an immigration station . between 1892 and 1954 , the island become ? for more than 17 million soul ? the doorway to america . a you will see in their own word below , america offer immigrant more than just opportunity . you also will see that the `` the land of the free `` be not so free to everyone , after all . escape to america the close year of the 19th century be an oppressive time in many eastern and southern european nation . in such country a russia , poland , and armenia , million of family be suffer . war , famine , and pogrom ( organize massacre of jew and other minority ) cause million of people to flee . ida mouradjian flee to america from armenia to escape annihilation by the turkish government : they [ the turk ] would displace every armenian out of their own home , out of their own town and drive them into the syrian desert . the idea be to get every armenian there and by the time they get there they would either die of hunger or exposure or pestilence . but not all be run from the horror of violence or poverty . some , like theodore lubik from the ukraine , want to avoid the military draft and simply saw the u.s. a a great opportunity : a friend of mine , he have go to america . he come to europe once on a visit ... he look just like a governor ? horse , wagon , dress fine , give his pocket change to u . he give me ten cent or a quarter ? that be big money . hard time travel in these time of turmoil , one could not easily move to the u.s . the trial of get to elli island be often life-threatening in themselves . along the way , many immigrant have to contend with border guard , thieve , and crook immigration agent . but it be the trip across the atlantic that immigrant tend to remember most . cram into poorly ventilate sleep area or cabin below deck , immigrant ? many of whom have never see the sea before ? often suffer rough cross . vera gauditsa , pregnant during her cross from czechoslovakia , remember the torture of seasickness : i be pretty tough , but on the boat i be very sick . i think the child want to be bear right then . i have a cabin , but in the cabin be nothing . you have to go through the whole boat to get to the shower and a toilet . so imagine when you be sick and you have to go to the bathroom and walk ! but upon see their destination , most immigrant ? like sarah asher from russia ? forget about sickness and think only of a bright future : about four or five o'clock in the morning we all get up . the sunshine start and what do we see ? the statue of liberty ! well , she be beautiful with the early-morning light . everybody be cry . beautiful color , the greenish-like water ? and so big . we could see new york already , with the big build and everything . . . there be a house where the boat stop but only the american be able to go out , but we foreigner remain . our boat move further , and that be when we realize we be go to elli island . stick at the door have to wait while first- and second-class passenger get off the boat , many immigrant begin to realize that their trouble be not over . after dock at manhattan island , immigrant in steerage be ship by barge to elli island , to go through examination . on the island , the immigrant be guide into hold pen in the great hall . irene zambelli , from greece , recall the routine : there be little gate , the same a you go [ through ] to the subway . . . the first gate we [ irene and her cousin ] pas they ask what we be to one another . then we come to the next gate and they ask u how much be two and two , and four and four . we answer and go to the next gate . cut back the flow the number of immigrant increase over the year , peak at 1,285,349 in 1907 . u.s. official grow concern . they saw the grow number a a threat to american worker . the official be afraid the foreigner would take away wag and job . a a result , the entrance examination be make tougher . they include a medical exam and a literacy test . an immigrant who fail one of these test face deportation ( be send back ) to his or her native country . of all the examination , the medical exam seem to cause immigrant the most concern , recall catherine bolinski , who come from poland : they turn your eye [ lid ] over ? i have to blink a couple of time that way . i 'll never forget it . they look at your throat and to see if you have any rash on your body . they find thing wrong with some people . they send them back , after they [ have ] sell everything to come here , so they be cry , they felt very bad . the think of be deport be terrify . fannie kligerman , who escape from russia with her family , remember the fear : one of my brother have something wrong with him . it be a sty . it leave a funny thing and they put him aside . and they tell u that if there be anything wrong with him , he 'd have to go back to europe . oh , it be frighten . my father say , `` i 'm not go on without the child . we will all go back . `` chart america 's course only three percent of those who arrive at elli island between 1892 and 1954 be turn away . by 1924 , however , the government change it policy . it slam shut the `` open door `` that have allow so many million to flock to the u.s . the immigration act of 1924 set a quota of 164,000 immigrant per year . by 1954 , elli island have be shut down . but for those who have pas through , america be truly a land of opportunity ? despite often-severe hardship . settle throughout the u.s. , immigrant such a composer irving berlin , football coach knute rockne , and supreme court justice felix frankfurter add to america 's strength . have escape from russia , arnold wei voice the determination and hope of the immigrant who pas through elli island : from the whole story of what i go through in all my year ? and some of it be n't very pleasant ? i still love this country . i love this country in spite of everything . from `` elli island : doorway to america `` by bill walter . publish in junior scholastic , april 6 , 1990 .

      "the sharebots by carl zimmer when robot go to kindergarten in maja matari 's lab , they learn an important lesson about how to get along in robot society . no man be an island , and maja matari think no robot should be either . matari , a brandeis university computer scientist , believe robot will do their best work only when they begin to work together . `` how do you get a herd of robot to do something without kill each other ? `` she ask . accord to matari , you have to put them in society and let them learn from one another , just a seagull and baboon and people do . matari have already make an impressive start at teach robot social skill . she have get 14 robot to cooperate at once ? the biggest gaggle of machine ever to socialize . the nerd herd , a matari call them , be shoe-box-size machine , each of which have four wheel , two tongs to grab thing , and a two-way radio . the radio allow them to triangulate their position with respect to two fix transmitter a they wander around matari 's lab . it also allow them to broadcast their coordinate and other information to their neighbor . infrared sensor help the robot find thing and avoid obstacle ; contact-sensitive strip tell them when they 've crash anyway . each robot be program with a handful of what matari call behavior ? set of instruction that enable the robot to accomplish a small goal , like follow the robot in front of it . set one robot on the floor with it wheel turn permanently to the leave and program the others to follow , and they will all drive in a circle until their battery go dead . but matari can get more interest action out of the herd by program them to alternate among several behavior . by tell them to home in on a target , to aggregate when they 're too far from one another , to disperse when they 're too crowd and to avoid collision at all time , she 's be able to get scatter robot to come together and migrate across her lab like a flock of bird . more important , the robot can also learn on their own to carry out more complex task . one task matari set for them be to forage for little metal puck and bring them home to their nest in a corner of the lab . to give the task a natural flavor , matari give the robot clock ; at `` night `` they have to go home and rest , and in the `` morning `` they look for puck again . in addition to five basic behavior they could choose from , she endow them with a sort of prime directive : to maximize their individual point score . each time a robot do something right , such a locate a puck , it be automatically reward with point ; each time it commit a blooper , such a drop a puck , it lose point . matari 's nerd herd , with the puck they now pursue collectively . after some random experimentation , the robot soon learn how to forage but not very well , because they tend to interfere with one another in their selfish pursuit of point . `` why should you ever stop and let someone else go ? `` ask matari . `` it 's always in your interest to go but if everybody feel that way , then nobody get through and they jam up and fight for space . `` to make her creature more efficient , though , matari find she do n't have to program them with a god's-eye view of what be good for all robot . she just have to teach each robot to share to let other robot know when it have find a puck , and to listen to other robot in return . `` i put in the impetus to pay attention to what other robot be do , and to try what other robot be try , share the experience , `` matari explain . `` if i do some thing that 's good and if i say , 'that be really great , ' then you may try it . `` with this simple social contract , the robot need only 15 minute of practice to become altruistic . they would magnanimously announce their discovery of puck , despite have no way of know that this be good for the herd a a whole . at time when two robot lunge for a puck , they would stop and go through an `` after you ! `` `` no , after you ! `` routine , but eventually they figure out the proper way to yield . with social grace , the robot herd bring home the puck twice a fast a without . matari think she 'll be able to produce more complex robot society . `` i 'm look at get specialization in the society so they can say , 'i 'll do this , and you do that . ' if one of them have a low battery , it may become the messenger that do n't actually carry thing . and i imagine one robot might emerge a a leader because it happen to be the most efficient . but if it stop be efficient , some other robot will take over . `` by past aside by away walker Zimmer Zimmer_frame automaton robot golem go spell tour turn Adam ecstasy XTC go disco_biscuit cristal X

      "the lose people of mesa verde by elsa marston the anasazi live peacefully on the mesa for 800 year . then they disappear . in the dry land of southwestern colorado a beautiful plateau rise . it have so many tree that early spanish explorer call it mesa verde , which mean `` green table . `` for about eight hundred year native american call the anasazi live on this mesa . and then they leave . ever since the cliff house be first discover a hundred year ago , scientist and historian have wonder why . anasazi be a navajo word mean `` the ancient one . `` when they first settle there , around 500 a. d. , the anasazi live in alcove in the wall of the high canyon . later they move to the level land on top , where they build house of stone and mud mortar . a time pas , they construct more elaborate house , like apartment build , with several family live close together . the anasazi make beautiful pottery , turquoise jewelry , fine sash of weave hair , and basket weave tightly enough to hold water . they live by hunt and by grow corn and squash . their way of life go on peacefully for several hundred year . then around 1200 a.d. something strange happen , for which the reason be not quite clear . most of the people move from the level plateau back down into alcove in the cliff . the move must have make their live difficult because they have to climb back up to the plateau to do the farm . but it seem the anasazi plan to stay in the canyon wall , for they soon fill the alcove with amaze cliff dwell . `` cliff palace , `` the most famous of these , have more than two hundred room . for all the hard work that go into build these new home , the anasazi do not live in them long . by 1300 a.d. the cliff dwell be empty . mesa verde be desert and remain a ghost country for almost six hundred year . be the people drive out of their home by enemy ? no sign of attack or fight , or even the presence of other tribe , have be find . archaeologist who have study the place now believe there be other reason . mesa verde , the beautiful green table , be no longer a good place to live . for one thing , in the second half of the thirteenth century there be long period of cold , and very little rain fell ? or else it come at the wrong time of year . scientist know this from examine the wood use in the cliff dwell . the growth ring in tree show good and bad grow season . but the people have survive drought and bad weather before , so there must have be another reason . a the population grow , more land on the mesa top have to be farm in order to fee the people . that mean that tree have to be cut to clear the land and also to use for house and fuel . without the forest , the rain begin to wash away the mesa top . how do we know about erosion problem that happen about eight hundred year ago ? the anasazi build many low dam across the smaller valley on the mesa to slow down rain runoff . even so , good soil wash away , and the people could no longer raise enough food . a the forest dwindle , the animal , already over ? hunt , leave the mesa for mountainous area with more tree . and a the mesa `` wear out , `` so do the people . it appear that the anasazi be not healthy . scientist can learn a lot about ancient people 's health by study the bone and teeth find in burial . the mesa dweller have arthritis , and their teeth be wear down by the grit in corn meal , a main part of their diet . a food become scarce , people grow weaker . not many live beyond their twenty . woman die very young , and few baby survive . live so close together in the cliff house , where everyone be hungry and worry , the people must have suffer from emotional strain . they probably quarrel often . in the end the anasazi must have give up hope that thing would get better . family pack up and go away . of course , the `` ancient one `` do not simply disappear . they move southeast to another area and mingle with other people . after a while their heritage a the people of the mesa verde be forget . in time the tree grow back and the plateau become green once more . but , for the anasazi it be too late . although they respect nature and try to farm wisely , land that be use too hard could not support them forever . yet in their cliff house and craft the `` ancient one `` leave u a superb monument . it be truly one of the most fascinate

      "the oregon trail american have long be think of a a restless group of people . they seem to have always be on the move , search for a better place to live . from america 's first colony small group of people uproot themselves , migrate westward to look for better farmland . they build pioneer road , or trail , such a the cumberland road that lead into the ohio valley , and the genesee road that lead across new york to the shore of lake erie . many of these road and trail have disappear . others can still be trace , reveal artifact along the way that help u to recreate their story . the oregon trail be one of these trail . even today you can retrace it path , walk beside wagon rut that be gouge almost a century and a half ago . the oregon trail be different from the earlier trail and road that have cross the appalachian mountain in the east . it be longer and more difficult than most pioneer have experience . unlike the eastern trail , the oregon trail cross nearly 2,000 mile of unfamiliar prairie , desert , and mountainous region . there be no settlement along the way that could offer friendly hospitality , and emigrant could n't scout out their new homeland before they move there . oregon country be so far away , it take from four to six month to get there . when people move there , they move to stay . the story of the oregon trail and the people who use it begin when the trail be an ancient indian footpath use by explorer and fur trader . independence , missouri , be the frontier town that serve a the start place . the trail wind westward , follow the bank of the platte , north platte , and snake river . it cross the rockies through the south pas , cross the blue mountain further north , and end in oregon country at a place call the dalles . from the dalles , anyone continue on to the williamette valley float down the columbia river . up until the mid-1830s , no wagon have ever make the trip . it be difficult for u to imagine oregon country a it be a century and a half ago . a vast wilderness that stretch from the crest of the rockies to the pacific coast , it include the present state of oregon , washington , and idaho . the area be inhabit by several tribe of indian , include the cayuse , umatilla , and nez perce . there be some trapper and trader in the region , but to most , the area be too far away and too strange for them to consider settle there . president thomas jefferson be the first to actively encourage exploration of oregon country . after the louisiana purchase of 1803 , he send meriwether lewis and william clark into the area to seek a trade route to the pacific . jefferson know that their exploration would help the unite state strengthen it claim to the pacific northwest . it be important to remember that for the first half of the nineteenth century both great britain and the unite state occupy the pacific northwest . great britain already have a strong claim to the land that be to become canada , and the hudson 's bay company have many fur trade post in the pacific northwest . there be american fur trade post a well , such a the american fur company organize by john jacob astor in 1808 . in 1818 , great britain and the unite state sign a treaty that allow both country to occupy the area , but it be not until the 1830s that american begin move in . missionary , such a marcus and narcissa whitman , be among the first settler . when people learn that the whitman have journey successfully over the oregon trail in 1836 , they begin to think differently about oregon country . the fact that a woman have make the journey safely , and that the whitman have travel with a wagon , encourage others to think that they could make the journey , too . in fact , when dr. whitman return east in 1842 to help promote his missionary work , he find many people who be eager to travel to oregon country . in 1843 , some 1,000 people and 2,000 animal join dr. whitman and a surveyor name jesse applegate a they lead a wagon train over the oregon trail . the `` great migration `` ? one of the greatest migration in record history ? have begin . why be so many people go to oregon country ? some say they have oregon fever , a `` disease `` that make them restless , hungry for new land , and eager for adventure . but why be they go all the way to oregon country ? one very important reason be that the unite state government be encourage them to do so . since thomas jefferson 's presidency , our government have come a long way toward believe that the unite state should stretch from coast to coast . if american be to settle the oregon country in large number , our claim to the land would be strengthen . one man in particular write report about the oregon country that be design to make people want to go there . his name be john charles fremont ( 1813-90 ) . he be a soldier , explorer and political leader who , in 1838 , be ask to be the chief assistant in map the upper water of the mississippi and missouri river . he write very detail description of his exploration , and his report be reprint and read by many people . it be fremont who write guidebook for emigrant who be encourage to settle in oregon country and help wrest it from british control . a american begin pour into the williamette river valley in the 1840s , a dispute between great britain and the unite state almost cause a war . the biggest disagreement be over the northern boundary of the oregon country . the british want the boundary to be on the north bank of the columbia river . the american want it further north on the 54th parallel . after careful negotiation , war be prevent when the two country sign the oregon treaty of 1846 . they agree to compromise , place the boundary on the 49th parallel extend to puget sound and leave vancouver island a a part of canada . the oregon treaty give the unite state undisputed claim to the pacific northwest , encourage even more emigrant to move west . by the 1850s , the oregon trail have become a series of parallel wagon rut that could be see even in solid rock . oregon country officially become the oregon territory in 1848 . in 1859 , the state of oregon be create and admit to the union a the 33rd state . twenty year earlier the area have be an unknown wilderness ! what be it like to travel on the oregon trail in the 1840s and 1850s ? fortunately there be many account that have survive , write by the people who use the trail and who want to preserve their experience for later generation . the story of the sager child be preserve by three of the sager girl who survive . diary , such a the one hand down to jean burroughs , provide eyewitness account of the daily travel . when we read these account , we can easily imagine the hardship , the anxiety , and the excitement the emigrant must have experience . accord to several historian , at least 30,000 emigrant die on the oregon trail between 1843 and 1859 . you might say that there be an average of one grave for every 100 yard of trail from the missouri river to the williamette river ! why do so many people die ? cholera , a disease that spread when there be filthy condition cause by garbage and sewage , claim thousand of live . emigrant pas through , and sometimes camp near , the refuse leave by earlier wagon train . other disease cause people to die , but cholera be probably the most common . accident be another common cause of death . child often hurt themselves a the wagon roll along . doctor be not always available , and even when they be they often lack necessary supply . most of the emigrant be simply not prepare for the difficult journey ahead , and they be careless . there be some problem a the emigrant pas through indian territory . indian attack usually take the form of raid on the livestock , but few people be ever kill . the indian own much of the land on both side of the oregon trail , and the emigrant be trespass . some tribal leader demand payment a the wagon train roll through , and , if the emigrant cooperate , there be no further trouble . in other instance , the indian make a surprise attack , take livestock , and leave the wagon unharmed . it would be several year later , in the 1860s , when the indian would finally realize that their homeland have be lose forever . tribal chief , such a red cloud and crazy horse , both of the oglala sioux , devote their live to try to save their homeland and people . but the idea that the unite state should stretch from coast to coast have already take hold . the oregon trail , no longer just a footpath , have open the way to the west . from cobblestone 's december , 1981 , issue : the oregon trail .

      "nettie 's big fish by jean m. burroughs `` here 's your bait hook and line , daughter . see what you can land . every family in our wagon train need fresh fish for supper . `` nettie emory 's father stand by her on the bank of the north platte river late one even in june , 1863 . `` and mind you keep your shoe on this time , pet . `` nettie draw down the corner of her mouth in disappointment . she 'd be count on cool water and squishy mud to cool her foot , hot and sweaty from her high ? top , lace shoe . she know her father be refer to the time she have wander from camp to gather `` yellow rose , `` the entice bloom of prickly pear cactus . step on dozen of sticker in her bare foot be a painful experience she would never forget . she 'd never see cactus before so how be she suppose to know ? now , hold her line and hook high , nettie edge closer to the water , hop against hope she would catch a fish . otherwise , it be go to be salt bacon and corn pone for supper again . after several week on the oregon trail , their supply of meat be use up . even wild game have be scarce , and they have not yet reach the plentiful buffalo on the plain . she be certainly tire of the monotonous diet . nettie 's father call back over his shoulder . `` remember there 's quicksand and sinkhole . test the grind before you step . stay close to me . good luck , blackie . `` nettie grin at her father 's use of her nickname , give because of her unusually dark hair and eye . her french mother prefer minette , but have agree to the shorten form of nettie . an only child , the nine ? year ? old girl answer to all the name that her love parent call her . she be proud that her father have be choose wagon master to lead the train over the plain and mountain to faraway oregon . perhaps if she catch a fish , he 'd be proud of her too , just a he be when she drive the ox team safely during her mother 's illness . she want to help him during this difficult journey a much a she could . she watch him and the other men choose place to cast their line at the water 's edge . some wad into the shallow near the sand island in the river where the current be run swifter because of a recent rain . through a thicket of willow she edge closer to where a quiet pool have form under the tree root . just the place for a fish to hide , she think . she quietly drop her hook , watch it sink to the bottom . then she wait , swing her sun-bonnet string back and forth to brush off the gnat and mosquito that hum around her face . she wait . she wait , but no fish rise to her bait . a she slide down the riverbank she keep her father 's black hat in sight . her line drift faster with the fresh current . fish can be tiresome , she fret , but it 's better than just watch the trail from the back of our crowd wagon . none of the men have catch a fish so far . she squint at the sun , well above the horizon of the summer sky . there 's plenty of time before supper fire be light , she think . with her leave hand she slap at a pesky mosquito again ; her right hand tighten it grip on the pole . a sudden jerk on the line cause her to stumble forward to keep her balance . a bite ! a bite ! the pull on her line be steady and strong . she lift her pole and it bend forward . it surely must be a big one . and it be a big one , big enough to pull nettie dangerously toward the water . her breath come in gasp . she dig in the heel of her sturdy shoe , glad now that she be n't barefoot . she could n't back up because the end of the line be move fast toward the center of the river . she could no longer see her father 's hat because of the tall rush grow at water 's edge . grimly , she hold on . her foot be already soak . would her next step be into quicksand ? the line move downstream , drag nettie into ankle ? deep , then knee ? deep water . she be excite about the catch and dare not let go . she also be become a little frighten . `` papa , papa , i 've get a big one ! `` she cry . `` it 's pull me into the river ! `` her voice be lose in the even breeze that stir the rush . `` papa , ca n't you hear me ? `` how much longer could she hold on ? she use all her strength . her shoulder ache from the strain . `` help ! help ! `` she shout to anyone who might hear her . she turn her body so that the line wrap around her hip . her leg sink deeper into the sandy bottom . muddy water billow out her full skirt . `` i 'm like an umbrella , `` she laugh to herself . `` now maybe they 'll see me . `` fresh fish or dry salt bacon : the very think give her extra endurance . not just for her own family , but the other wagon people who be also hungry for a change in diet . draw a deeper breath , she call hoarsely , `` save me ! save my fish ! `` an answer shout give her courage . she hear footstep splash nearer . `` blackie , hold on . pull back , `` call her father . other men drop their pole and run to help . josiah emory place his body in front of his little girl 's , grab the line with his strong hand . nettie cling to the pole while her father slowly , steadily , pull in the line . soon a flash , grey body flap in and out of the water . `` it 's a big catfish , blackie , a really huge one . good girl ! i 'm proud of you . `` only then do nettie let go . he lift the pole with a grunt at the unexpected weight . indeed , it be a huge fish . her father guess it be over three foot long and more than twenty-five pound . slosh back to the wagon , muddy and exhaust , nettie wonder what her mother would say . her dress and petticoat be cake with red mud . her shoe squish water through the lace . now perhaps i can go barefoot until my shoe dry , she think . she hop her mother would be so glad over the fish that she would n't scold . news of nettie 's big catch spread among the wagon . a hungry crowd gather to watch while nettie 's father dress the fish . `` build up the fire , `` he say . `` we 'll all feast tonight . no ration of salt pork but fresh fish for all . `` `` and biscuit and syrup instead of corn bread ? `` nettie ask her mother . `` yes , minette . all the biscuit and syrup and fish you can eat . `` nettie grin a happy , tire grin . `` i 'll always remember how that fish almost swim away with me . i be go to write about it in my diary . `` a note from the author : this be a true story . a copy of nettie emory 's diary be give to me by her granddaughter . from nettie 's entry about her trip on the oregon trail , write in 1863 , i have retell her excite adventure with the big fish . of course i use imaginary conversation and description . this be what nettie write in her diary : `` i be allow to fish with the men in the missouri river . suddenly a fish take my bait , and i be pull to the water 's edge . my father hear my call for help . he begin to run when he saw me splash in the water . other men help him land the fish while i go back to the wagon to dry out . the fish be over three foot long and weigh about 25 pound . i be the only one who catch a fish that day but we share it with the others . `` from cobblestone 's december , 1981 , issue : the oregon trail . large big big bad big big big
